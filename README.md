## About
 I created a github repository and cloned the code of this repository to a new local area on my device.

 I have added a README file to give a brief description of the project.

 I linked a stylesheet to the index.html for css designs.

 I included a working <nav> that links to the relative sections of the page including to the contact info in the footer.

 I added a hover effect over images that displayed centered text over the greyed out image. To do this i created seperate div containers with the same ID (to style them under the same class) using 
 <div class= "container">
 <div class="row"> 
<div class="text"> // to add the text for the hover effect. 
Then in the css i styled the hover with opacity effects.

I deployed my project with a live URL by creating the URL using github pages in the settings of this repository.
